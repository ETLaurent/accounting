## Calculate Remaining Balance After Monthly Transactions 💸

### Overview

This script calculates how much is left in your balance after deducting monthly expenses.

### Notes

> App is written in Python because it's wildly included by default in most of Linux and macOS systems.  
> It's also a good occasion for me to ~use~ learn Python (code isn't state-of-the-art, far from it).  
> It's a CLI usage, there is no web server, to keep it simple. However, persistence would be a good thing, and is the next milestone.

### Usage

```
usage: run.py [-h] [-c [CURRENCY]] [-a {a_bank,another_bank} [{a_bank,another_bank} ...]]
              [-p [{bank_fees,gym,newspaper,spotify,energy,mortgage,insurances} ...]]
              [-r [{salary,rent} ...]]
              [-e [ADDITIONAL_EXPENSE_AMOUNTS ...]]
              [-i [ADDITIONAL_INCOME_AMOUNTS ...]] [-b [CURRENT_BALANCE]]

Determine the remaining balance after monthly transactions.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c [CURRENCY], --currency [CURRENCY]
                        Currency symbol to show. Adding a leading underscore will place the symbol before the amount.
                        For instance, "_€" will print "foo: +10€" instead of "foo: +€10".
  -a {a_bank,another_bank} [{a_bank,another_bank} ...], --banks {a_bank,another_bank} [{a_bank,another_bank} ...]
                        Banks to use in the calculation.
  -p [{bank_fees,gym,newspaper,spotify,energy,mortgage,insurances} ...], --paid [{bank_fees,gym,newspaper,spotify,energy,mortgage,insurances} ...]
                        Expense names to be removed from the calculation.
  -r [{salary,rent} ...], --received [{salary,rent} ...]
                        Income names to be removed from the calculation.
  -e [ADDITIONAL_EXPENSE_AMOUNTS ...], --additional-expense-amounts [ADDITIONAL_EXPENSE_AMOUNTS ...]
                        Expense amounts to add to the calculation.
  -i [ADDITIONAL_INCOME_AMOUNTS ...], --additional-income-amounts [ADDITIONAL_INCOME_AMOUNTS ...]
                        Income amounts to add to the calculation.
  -b [CURRENT_BALANCE], --current-balance [CURRENT_BALANCE]
                        Current balance before calculation.

### TODO

- Persist expenses to allow adding, removing, and updating them via the CLI.
- Implement unit tests 🙄
- Publish package
